The project involves creating a web scraper in Python to extract data from the E-procurement Government of India website, specifically from pages listing tenders by different organizations. The scraper is implemented as a Python class, making it a reusable component. The extracted data includes details such as serial numbers, organization names, and the number of tenders they have listed.

Here is a summary of the key components and steps:

1. A Python class is created to serve as the web scraper, making it easy to instantiate and use.

2. The scraper sends HTTP requests to the target website, retrieves the HTML content, and parses it using BeautifulSoup.

3. It identifies and extracts the relevant data elements from the HTML, including serial numbers, organization names, and the number of tenders.

4. The extracted data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame.

5. The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file, making it easy to store and share the collected data.

Finally, users can access the scraped data by loading the CSV file into a DataFrame and using Python to manipulate, analyze, or display the information as needed.
